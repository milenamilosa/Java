Chip the glasses and crack the plates
  Far over the misty mountains cold  

       O! what are you doing?       
    Clap! snap! the black crack!    

   Fifteen birds in five fir trees   
 The wind was on the withered heath 

 Old fat spider spinning in a tree! 
         Roll-roll-roll-roll         

   The king beneath the mountains   
  Under the mountain dark and tall  

       The dragon is withered       
         Sing all ye joyful!         

       Roads go ever, ever on
