Chip the glasses and crack the plates
far over the misty mountains cold
O! What are you doing?



Clap! Snap! The black crack!
Fifteen birds in five fir trees
the wind was on the withered heath
old fat spider spinning in a tree!


Roll-Roll-Roll-Roll
The King beneath the mountains

Under the mountain dark and tall
the dragon is withered
Sing all ye joyful!
Roads go ever, ever on
